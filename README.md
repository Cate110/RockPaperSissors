# RockPaperSissors-V2

1st project I did on my own, as an exercise for The Odin Project. A 
simple game of Rock Paper Scissors, being the 1st project, has a lot of
room for improvement, but it helped me to deepen my knowledge of
HTML, CSS and JavaScript, along with the first experiences using the
DOM elements.
